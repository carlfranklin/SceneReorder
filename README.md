# Scene Reorder

This .NET 5 console application lets users of the Presonus StudioLive RM32AI mixer (now obsolete) swap channels, copy channel settings (preamp level, hpf, gate, compressor, eq, and limiter) from one channel to another, and reset channels to have no icon.

In the future I will support other Presonus devices, but here it is in its naked beauty!
